                "The computer (or rather the software in it) was smart enough
                to recognize that it was being asked to perform more tasks than
                it should be performing. It then sent out an alarm, which meant
                to the astronaut, I'm overloaded with more tasks than I should
                be doing at this time and I'm going to keep only the more
                important tasks; i.e., the ones needed for landing ...
                Actually, the computer was programmed to do more than recognize
                error conditions. A complete set of recovery programs was
                incorporated into the software. The software's action, in this
                case, was to eliminate lower priority tasks and re-establish the
                more important ones ... If the computer hadn't recognized this
                problem and taken recovery action, I doubt if Apollo 11 would
                have been the successful moon landing it was."
